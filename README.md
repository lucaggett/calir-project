The folder "code" contains all python code that was used for the assignment. In each subfolder of this directory, you can find another markdown file containing more information about the scripts in that folder.

# Libraries

We've collected all dependencies required for the scripts into a requirements.txt file. You can install them by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory of this repository.
